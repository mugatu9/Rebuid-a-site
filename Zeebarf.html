<h2><span itemprop="name">Reemus</span> does <span itemprop="name">Unity</span></h2>


<p>So I've been trying to accomplish small goals every day, one thing that had been eluding me up until now was getting <span itemprop="name>"Unity</span> into this squarespace layout. After a bit of Google sleuthing I finally found the solution, so here's Reemus inside the <span itemprop="name>"Unity</span> engine for the first time ever. This may seem like nothing but it took me a couple months to learn all the little pieces to make Reemus walk around this room. The <span itemprop="featureList">cursor</span> is a new addition, it's going to give you <span itemprop="featureList">different options when you scroll over a hotspot</span>. Which is a big difference from the strict one click design of the other <span itemprop="applicationCategory">games</span>. I thought giving the option to "look at" something would give more opportunity for jokes and hints, so I'm trying it out. </p>

<p>So the plan now is to get chunks of the <span itemprop="applicationCategory">game</span> finished and beta test them in the browser like this. I also received an email from Bill D. who suggested I start you tubing the process again, so I'm going to do that too. In the meantime, make Reemus walk around his room. (I need a higher res export of the BG, looks a little fuzzy on here.)</p>

<p>EDIT - I removed the file, it worked great at first but something went wacky and I couldn't load it without my browser crashing. Not sure if worked for anyone else. Back to the drawing board!</p>
